## Production Setup
**We have tested the setup on `Ubuntu`, `Debian` and `AWS Linux 2`. We are working toward making the installer compatible with other Linux distros as well.**

`Swiftwave` can be installed with one click.
> We recommend using a fresh server for production setup. If you are using an existing server, please ensure you have stopped all the services running on ports 80 and 443.

Run this command in bash
```bash
 curl -L get.swiftwave.org | bash
```

That's all üçª

Wait for ‚è∞  few minutes, and it will become online.
